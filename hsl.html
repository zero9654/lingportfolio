					<h5>The Problem</h5>
					<p>HSL Transitlog is a web application developed by HSL. 
						It is a new product for the purpose of tracking and monitoring public transportation schedules in the whole Helsinki region. 
						The product manager has realized the potential usability problems in the product, 
						but they don't have a professional UX team to conduct the testing. The goal is to <mark>minimize the usability issues and make the application easy-to-use.</mark>

				<h3 class="mb-4">User Groups</h3>
				<p>
					HSL Transitlog is designed for internal use. There are three main user groups for HSL Transitlog.
				</p>
				<ol style="color:black;">
					<li>Contract handlers: they are responsible to check faults in routes</li>
					<li>Feedback managers: they verify and take care of written feedback</li>
					<li>Helpdesk officer: they offer assistance through calls</li>
				</ol>

		<div class="row mt-5">
			<div class="col-lg-8">
				<h3 class="mb-4">Usability Testing Results</h3>
				<p>We had 1 contract handler participant, 2 helpdesk officer participants, and 2 feedback manager participants.</p>
				<p>
					In general, 2 out of 5 participants were able to complete all tasks, and 1 participant failed all tasks. 
					In terms of color-coding used in the system <mark>(green=on time; yellow=late; red=early)</mark>, 
					only 1 participant completely understood the meaning directly, the rest were not sure or had to think a while about the meaning of the colors.

				<img src="images/portfolio/transitlog-search.png" alt="" class="img-fluid w-100">
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<p>Each user group had different filtering habits, but the most used filter was on the bus line, route direction, and date which are placed in the top search bar. 
					However, <mark>none</mark> of the participants was able to <mark>recover from a wrong result</mark>, they simply reset all inputs and started over again.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row mt-5">
			<div class="col-lg-8">
				<p>Participants performed tasks differently according to their own technical experience and mental state. Performance was varied, there was one participant who succeeded in completing each task with less than 10 actions in 2 minutes. Another participant was too stressed to calm down and accomplish tasks.</p>
				<p>In terms of satisfaction, 2 out of 5 participants felt frustrated while working with Transitlog. But, 3 participants felt that the overall look and feel is pleasant. </p>

				<h3 class="mb-4">Usability Testing</h3>
				<p>
					We asked the product manager to invite participants from 3 main user groups.
					Considering the working time, the product manager sets up half an hour of meetings with representatives from each group.
				</p>

				<p>We wanted to do the usability testing in <mark>the place where participants are familiar with</mark>. 
				We also asked them to <mark>bring their own laptop</mark>, so the test environment is <mark>close to the real work</mark>. So, the usability test was carried out in an HSL meeting room. 
				</p>

				<p>
				Participants, a facilitator, a data logger, and an observer all stayed in the same room, as the picture showed. 
				The data logger sat left behind the participant with the camera. The facilitator sat right next to the participant, 
				while the test observer sat opposite to the participant so as to observe the participantâ€™s facial expression.
				</p>

				<h5 class="mb-3">Procedure</h5>
				<p>Welcome the participant -> Explain each evaluator's role to the participant and the testing procedure -> Give out tasks -> If the participant gets stuck with a task for too long, let him/her move on. -> Hand out the post-questionnaire -> Wrap up the testing</p>

				<h5 class="mb-3"> Tasks
				</h5>
				<p><mark>Each user group has specific needs regarding the Transitlog.</mark> So, I designed common tasks for all user groups, and specific tasks for each user group.</p>
		
				<h5 class="mb-3"> Testing Focus
				</h5>
				<p>Yes/No</p>
				<ol>
					<li>[Effectiveness] Are the users able to complete their tasks?</li>
					<li>[Effectiveness] Do the users understand the color coding of the application?</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Close-ended questions</p>
				<ol>
					<li>[Efficiency] What journey filtering mechanisms are most used?</li>
					<li>[Efficiency] How many steps does it take to recover from a wrong result?</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Open-ended questions</p>
				<ol>
					<li>[Efficiency] How efficiently do the users find the bus and the stop that they are looking for?</li>
					<li>[Satisfaction] What is the general disposition toward Transitlog?</li>
				</ol>

				<h3 class="mb-4">Reflection</h3>
				<p>
					We initially envisioned a test environment with two separate rooms: a controlled test room and an observation room, 
					connected by multiple video feeds. 
					The facilitator would sit together with the participant in the test room and their live actions would be sent through video and audio to the test room. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Unfortunately, we can't arrange that. <mark>The testing environment was not ideal</mark>. 
					Even though we explained our role to the participants, 3 out of 5 participants were nervous. 
					One participant was too anxious and failed all tasks. <mark>Having all evaluators in one room is probably pressure for participants.</mark> The test observer and data logger should stay in another room. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The majority of usability issues we detected had been resolved by the HSL developer team since we have been closely contacted with each other. We were glad to see they accept our suggestions, but the changing application also increased the challenges to evaluate it.
					A lot of results and findings were no longer valid so that it was impossible to compare the differences and track whether the improvement brings a better experience.
				</p>

				<p>	Besides, the final improvement we suggest is to have an onboarding tutorial. This onboarding could decrease the internal training for users and help users understand the features.
