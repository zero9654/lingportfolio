				<h3 class="mb-4">Problems</h3>
				<p> Finnish red cross youth shelter is a multi-professional community that gathers more than 700 volunteers and around 50 employees. Since 2020, they’ve dealt with 1157 cases, held 5911 meetings, and offered accommodation nights to 5813 people in need. </p>
				
				<h5 class="mb-3">
					Scattered and disconnected services 
				</h5>
				<p>The youth shelter provides all sorts of activities from one-to-one chat with mentors, peer groups to discuss or make friends, to digital civic councils. However, those services are quite scattered now. Currently, there is no central channel to gather information, phone calls, and email are the only way to reach out. Besides, no clear guidance is provided about what services are available and how users can utilize them. Due to these reasons, users might get lost during the service journey. 
				</p>

				<h5 class="mb-3">
				Privacy protection				
				</h5>
				<p> Normally, young people come to the youth shelter and talk face to face with mentors. 
					Due to the pandemic situation, most services have to transfer to the online environment. So the anonymity and untraceable features become the first priority to consider while choosing the right digital tools.  
					Concerning GDPR and web security, these requirements almost rule out all existing products in the market such as Zoom and teams. Whereas, the only communication tool they use crashes a lot. </p>

				<p>	On the other hand, although they tried best to ensure the security and privacy. It still inevitably causes trouble to the professionals and volunteers. There are often scenarios where young people have come for help several times but each time they still need to start explaining from the very beginning. This anonymity and untrackable features brings inconvenience and poor experience for young people. It also prevents professionals from providing long-term and persistent mental support. Overall, a balance between privacy protection and (web) connections should be a pain point to be discussed. 
					 </p>

				<h5 class="mb-3">
					Peer pressure		</h5>
				<p>For some young people, they may feel uncomfortable to express their strugglings openly. 
					Based on discussion with mentors, we understood that the huge sucess of Sekasin also thanks to the collaborations with influencers and yle. 
					So, this shall be taken into consideration how we can promote our services smoothly to avoid young people feel pressure or ashamed.

				<h3 class="mb-4">Future vision</h3>
				<p>The concept of Sanoo booth will first have a pilot testing for a week, and then scale up to the nationwide roadtrip. In the near future, we also have the vision to make the Sanoo booth serve a broader group of people. All residents, no matter what age, would be welcomed to our Sanoo booth to express their feelings and have a warm chat. We also have an idea to expand the Sanoo booth to accommodate a family which is also worth validating through the future pilot testing.  
				</p>
				<p>We are always improving, developing, and evolving together with our young people. Our vision is to create an open, warm and secure environment where young people could get their support, parents could get guidance, volunteers could gain information on lending a helping hand, and partners and donors could also get access to realize their value.
